						<h2>Sci-fi stories that got me hooked up with this genre...</h2>
						<span class="post-meta">7 min read &nbsp;Â·&nbsp; Dec 04, 2023</span>

						<p>Science fiction is a captivating genre, having about 7 - 10 percent of reading population. Since science is limitless and ever-evolving, sci-fi will never cease to capture new readers. 
							This genre has extended possibilities. All sci-fi stories are not Asimovian (inventing new concepts), rather transforming existing science to a new level. 
							Sci-fi had it's origin in the 1800s and as far as I know, when Frankenstein was published. Science fiction is not fantasy. Things that were considered fiction (robots in daily life, mission to mars, nanotechnology and many more) have been made possible.
						</p><br/>
						<p>I have been into this genre since 14, when I read an anthology of short sci-fi stories by many different authors. It literally opened up a new world for me. 
							I suggest people to subsume themselves to a story rather than just reading. Science fiction has allured me into the field of Artificial Intelligence and Aerospace engineering which led me to read actual books related to these fields. 
							I have listed few books which enhanced my reading habits and transported me to an interesting world.</p>
						
							<h3>Flowers for Algernon | Daniel Keyes</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="../../../images/flowers_for_algernon.jpg" alt="" /></span>This story is about a man (Charlie Gordon) who has a very low intellectual level, who is constantly bullied by his co-workers. But know what, his IQ is going to be the highest in a few days. 
								Initially, I was befuddled in the beginning of the story because the first few pages had typo errors. But later I realised, the story is presented through Gordon's view (a man with a very low IQ will make mistakes while spelling, won't he?). 
								The story reaches it's pinnacle when Gordon becomes intelligent through the successful neurological operation. He becomes interested in neurology and starts testing his skills on a rat (Algernon). He then goes on to publish a paper on his findings. But the story takes a big turn when he starts losing his newly-gotten ability. 
								He loses his intelligence faster than he gained it. And later on, goes working in the same old bullied-by-coworkers shop. This story emphasizes the plot of what happens when a person tries to do anything against nature. This story had a huge impact when I first read it, as it sails through Charlie Gordon's life.<br/>

							<h3 style="padding-top: 15px;">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy | Douglas Adams</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
							<hr />
						<p style="padding-top: 20px;">The series is filled with witty dialogues and THE best book recommendations. I started to seriously notice the book references when I watched Lorelai mentioning "Our town needs more Boo Radleys" ðŸ˜‚. I have jotted down all the recommendations and would love to read all 300 books mentioned in this series.</p>
